## Risk Management in Information Systems
### Most of this chapter is just common sense and very basic vocab
- Charts
  - Milestone Plan Chart: graphical representation of major milestones
  - Gantt Chart: Shows project schedule, a bit more detailed than the milestone chart
  - Critical Path ChartL Shows a list of project tasks that must be completed on time for the project to reach its deadlines
  - affinty diagram: group data/tasks into like categories
### NIST Risk Management Framework
1. Prepare step: includes all required activities
2. Categorize step: categorize the system and any info processed 
3. Select Step: setting up initial baseline controls
4. Implement Step: Implement and document security controls
5. Assess Step: Assess the security controls for efficacy
6. Authorize Step: Authorizes operation of a system after assessing risks
7. Monitor Step: continuously monitor the system

## Identifying Assets and Activities Within Risk Assessment Boundaries
- Asset valuation is the process of determining the fair markey valuation for an asset. 
  - can be determined by 
    - Replacement Value - the cost to purchase a new asser
    - Recovery value - the cost to recover an asset after failure
- Scope creep occurs when assets outside the scope of the risk assessment are evaluated
  
## Identifying and Evaluating Relevant Vulnerabilities
- Two things are certainly related to vulnerabilities:
  - All systems have vulnerabilities
  - Not all vulnerabilities result in a loss

## Identifying and Evaluating Controls
- When identifying and evaluating controls, the following should be considered:
  - In-Place Controls - controls already installed ni the OS
  - Planned controls - controls that have an implementation date
- Controls are typically categorized as: Procedural, Technical, or Physical
  - Procedural - controls put in place as a result of senior management rules and guidelines. Must be implemented in a written document. 
  - Technical - Uses computers or software to protect systems
  - Physical - controls the physical environment

## Developing Mitigating Recommendations
- After performing the analysis, specific recommendations can be provided to management, they should include: 
  - Threat/vulnerability pairs
  - Estimate of cost and time to implement
  - Estimate of operational impact
  - Cost-benefit analysis
## Presenting Risk Assessment Results
- After the risk assessment has been completed, a report documenting the results is created. This report should include two phases.
  - recommendations are presented to the managers
    - Because managers decide which controls to implement, they are also responsible for the residual risks.
  - In the second phase, the decisions made by the managers are documented. Then, a plan of action and milestones (POAM) is created.

## Techniques for identifying threats
- There are two primary techniques of identifying threats: Reviewing Historical Data and Performing Threat Modeling
- Reviewing Historical Data
  - Analyzing past incidents including those at your organization, similar organizations and in the local area
  - Typically done by compiling records and conducting interviews
- Performing Threat Modeling
  - This is ideally done when an application is written or a system is developed so security is part of the development lifecycle
  - Must first Identify valuable assets
  - Next, think like the adversary
  - Use the seven domains of IT
    - User Domain 
    - Workstation Domain
    - LAN Domain
    - LAN-To-WAN Domain
    - WAN Domain
    - Remote Access Domain
    - System/Application Domain
## Vulnerability Assessments
- One of the steps taken during a vuln assessment is to review the avaiable documentation including:
  - Incidents
  - Outage reports
  - Assessment Reports
- Vulnerability tools have many benifits incuding
  - identifying vulns
  - scanning systems and network
  - providing metrics
  - documenting results
- Audits are performed to check compliance with rules and guidelines. 
- Penetration testing attempts to exploit vulnerabilities. It verifies the effectiveness of controls, or countermeasures.
- A transaction in a database is a group of statements that either succeed or fail as a whole. If any single statement fails, the entire transaction fails.
## Exploit Assessment
- The difference between what is mitigated and what is not mitigated represents a gap in the security. A gap analysis report documents these differences.
  - A remediation plan is often included with a gap analysis. It includes details on what would need to be done to close the gap.
-  Change management is an important process because many IT outages occur due to unauthorized changes.
-  The easiest way to verify that an exploit has been mitigated is by using the same way it was originally identified. If a vulnerability scan found the problem, the scan should be run again. 
-  Best oractices for an exploit assesmsnet
   -  Get permission
   -  Identify as many exploits as possible
   -  use a gap analysis for compliance
   -  verify exploits have been mitigated
